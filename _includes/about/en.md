### About Me
#### Introduction

Hi, I'm Aditya ([01100001ditya](https://twitter.com/01100001ditya)), I'm a software engineer with experience in C,C++ and python, But i consider my self as tinker with hacker mentality. One who is curious about thing and system. From an early age, I have been driven by a fascination for making and breaking things.

#### Education

* Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) in Computer Science: KNIT Sultanpur, [2021]

#### Early On

During my Betech, I immersed myself in the world of computers and hardware, exploring the inner workings of machnine and system. That indeed increase my meataily and fuled my passion for the field.
* I had the incredible opportunity to intern with the Gurgaon Police, where I focused on cyber security, specially machine learing and AI in thins domain. This internship allowed me to gain hands-on experience with software and hardware simultaneously.
* ML Intern in IIT kanpur: 
* Amidst the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, I was fortunate to secure an internship opportunity at Lohia Mechatronik in Kanpur, where I worked as an intern in industrial machine vision. This invaluable experience allowed me to apply my knowledge to real-world challenges in the field of plastic machine manufacturing. It provided me with practical exposure and a deeper understanding of the practical applications of computer vision in an industrial setting.

#### Projects and Exploration

Significant projects done at that time:
1. OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence) gathering tool: I learned to extract valuable information from various online sources. This experience helped me understand the importance of data and its implications in the real world.
    
2. Real time facial recognition: I have also worked on a project focused on real-time facial recognition. Utilizing computer vision techniques, I developed an application that employed Haar cascades for face tracking and a deep neural network for face recognition against a pre-existing database. This project enhanced my skills in image processing and machine learning.

3. Smart complaint analyzer: This system had multiple components, including a full-stack application with a Flask backend, Android app, web app, Firebase database, and integrated email and forwarding capabilities. With the integration of natural language processing (NLP), this system was able to analyze and categorize customer complaints efficiently. Through these projects, I have gained hands-on experience in various aspects of software development, including data extraction, computer vision, machine learning, and full-stack development.
