# 3. The Masterplan

- Tips
    
    I wanna got to the top university for computer vision and robotics. for that i wanna do some project related to it and also reach out professor for showing my work before application. Also need to retake the gre (current score is 301) and ilets.
    

The Master plan
1. Goal #1: Improve on your application by improving GRE, ILETS/Toefl, LOR and SOP

- Develop a study plan for GRE and IELTS exams by researching dates and availability, using study materials, and taking mock tests
- Measurable outcome: Achieve a minimum score of 320 on GRE and 7.5 on IELTS by the end of December.
- GRE 19000
    
    16 August

- ILETS 16500
    
    20 September
    
    [IELTS Test Registration - IELTS IDP India](https://www.ieltsidpindia.com/registration/registration)
    

2. Goal #2: Work on a computer vision and robotics project

- Select and execute a suitable computer vision and robotics project by researching ideas, creating a plan with clear objectives and resources, consistently working on the project, and incorporating feedback from peers or mentors to improve it.
- Measurable outcome: Complete 3 relevant projects related to computer vision and robotics by the end of November.

3. Goal #3: Research and Apply to Top Universities

- To apply to a top computer vision and robotics program, research universities and professors, attend virtual events, draft personalized statements, seek feedback, and follow up with professors for advice.
- Measurable outcome: Submit applications to at least 5 top universities for computer vision and robotics before the deadline in December

### Actionable

Goal #1: Improve on your application by improving GRE, ILETS/Toefl, LOR and SOP

1. Plan 1: Schedule study time - Set aside specific blocks of time each day/week to study for GRE and ILETS/Toefl. Use study materials such as practice tests, study guides, and flashcards to improve your skills in each area.
2. Plan 2: Seek feedback from professors or mentors - Ask your professors or mentors for feedback on your LOR and SOP. Take their suggestions into account and make revisions to improve the quality of your application.
3. Plan 3: Take practice exams - Practice taking the GRE and ILETS/Toefl exams under timed conditions to simulate the real testing environment. Analyze your performance and identify areas that need improvement.

Goal #2: Work on a computer vision and robotics project

1. Plan 1: Identify a project - Choose a project that aligns with your interests and career goals in the computer vision and robotics field. Research online and network with professionals to find relevant ideas and resources.
2. Plan 2: Create a timeline - Set a timeline with specific milestones for your project, including research, planning, implementation, and testing. Break down each step into manageable tasks and allocate time for each task accordingly.
3. Plan 3: Collaborate with others - Seek feedback and advice from peers, professors, and mentors as you work on your project. Collaborate with others to improve your work and learn from their experiences.
