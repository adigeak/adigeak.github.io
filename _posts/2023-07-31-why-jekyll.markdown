Blog in logging your day, but the catch is to write it infornt of the world. It's about writing something weekly increases our commitement and gratitude towards our work.

## Why jekyll?

[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is a static page generator. It's supported by GitHub, so there is no extra effort in starting or maintaining it.

* I like [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).
* I like [GitHub](https://github.com/stared).
* I like simplicity. (And I don't need fancy features.)
* Yet, I want to configure and create some stuff.
* I use LaTeX and I want to be do more from it.
* I am concerned about archiving things in plain formats.
* I want to avoid distractions. (By editing in a text editor - VS code)
* Git commits gamify my efforts. (Seriously!)
