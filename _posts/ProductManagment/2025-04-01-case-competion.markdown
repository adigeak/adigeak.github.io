[Our journey](#start)

## Do you know what a case competition feels like?

If you've never done one, imagine compressing a startup lifecycle into a 72-hour mental marathon. You ideate, research, analyze, project, narrate, pitch — and then pray the judges see your logic. This one was a wild ride, and we want to share what went down, what we learned, and what stayed with us long after the final slide.

### The Case: Gramin E-Mobility – Powering Rural India


We participated in a business case competition focused on launching an EV startup for rural India. The challenge? Build a feasible and impactful go-to-market strategy that empowers rural populations like Rekha (an artisan) and Rajesh (a farmer), who struggle with mobility and cost-effective transport.

Our team — **MAD (Aditya & Mohit)** — dived deep into the unique constraints of rural economies, from affordability and charging access to behavioral barriers like trust and awareness.

## What We Proposed

- 2 products:
  - **Gramin Zippy** – a lightweight, low-maintenance electric two-wheeler for daily travel, targeting students, artisans, and small vendors.
  - **Gramin Hauler** – a rugged electric three-wheeler designed for farmers and traders to transport goods affordably and efficiently.
- **Battery-as-a-Service** – to lower upfront costs and increase adoption via monthly subscription and battery-swapping models.
- **Charging Infrastructure** – decentralized, solar-powered charging at key village locations like schools and haats.
- **Community-Centric Marketing** – emotional, local-language messaging with village fairs, WhatsApp broadcasts, and demo booths.
- **Financial Model** – break-even achievable in 18–20 months with support from subsidies (FAME-II), NBFC financing, and local partnerships.

## What We Learned (aka the MBA Gold)

1. **Every number needs a story.** It’s not just about showing ₹8.3 crore in revenue, but backing it with believable assumptions — down to EMI affordability in ₹8,000/month income households.

2. **Frameworks make sense... only if you *make* them make sense.** Think 4Ps, AIDA, TAM-SAM-SOM — but tailor them, don’t blindly apply.

3. **Execution eats strategy for breakfast.** The best ideas fail without a realistic execution roadmap. We focused hard on **pilot phases**, **ground partnerships**, and **behavioral nudges** like referral programs.

4. **Financial projections = clarity.** Build breakeven. Build worst-case. Build what-if-subsidies-vanish case. Numbers ground ideas.

5. **Concise is clear. Clear is compelling.** Our final PPT went through 6 ruthless trims. Charts replaced text. Visuals told the pitch. Keep it intuitive.

6. **Spot the gap — in the story and the numbers.** We repeatedly asked: “Why *this*? Why not *that*?” Finding weak links before the judges did made all the difference.

7. **AI is good for story, not for number and worst for justification.**  Use AI for compelling story to drive narative and justification for the number need human (as of now).

## Reflections: Beyond the Slides

This wasn’t just a competition. It felt like designing a real-world impact engine. We weren’t just solving for EV adoption — we were solving for **mobility, access, and agency** in the heart of India.

We left with a sharper brain, stronger bond as a team, and a deeper appreciation for how **business models can change lives**, especially when you hear stories like Rekha’s and Rajesh’s.

### Would we do it again?

In a heartbeat. Because in the end, it’s not just about winning cases — it’s about making a case *for something that matters*.
